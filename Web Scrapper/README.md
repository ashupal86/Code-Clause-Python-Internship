# Web Scrapper for fetching news Headlines


I developed this project as a Python intern at Code Clause. During my internship, I gained valuable experience in web scraping and building Flask applications. This project allowed me to apply my Python skills and learn about fetching news headlines from various sources. I am excited to share my work and contribute to the open-source community.



This project utilizes several modules to achieve its functionality:

- `Flask`: A web framework used to build the application and handle HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup`: A library used for web scraping, allowing the project to fetch news headlines from various sources.
- Other dependencies: Additional modules may be used depending on the specific requirements of the project.

These modules are essential for the proper functioning of the web scraper and Flask application. They provide the necessary tools and functionality to fetch and display news headlines in a user-friendly manner.

To contribute to this project, make sure you have these modules installed and properly configured in your development environment.
